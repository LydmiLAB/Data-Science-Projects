**Description:**  
- A service for selling used cars is developing an application to attract new customers. Here you can quickly find out the market value of your car.
- The customer defined the criteria for the model: quality of prediction; model training time; model prediction time.
- Data preparation was completed.
- 4 different models were trained and analyzed, the best model was selected from the training set. 
- Analysis of the speed and quality of models was carried out.
- A model has been built to determine the market value of the car required for the customer’s application.
  

**Result:**
- A car price recommendation model was built for the customer's application.
