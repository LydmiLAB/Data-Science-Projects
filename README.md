| A set of photographs of people indicating their age. | To built a recognition system to determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. | Python, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, tensorflow, statistics, PIL / ResNet50, ImageDataGenerator, mean_squared_error, Adam,GlobalAveragePooling2D, augmentation, image processing, neural networks |


**Description:**  

- A chain supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group an d monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of a set of photographs. Сonfigured parameters for training the model. 
- To solve the regression problem, a neural network model was trained and tested.
 
**Result:**
- A recognition model has been built to determine a person’s age from a photo. The model passed the customer metric threshold.
