**Description:**  
The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and processed the data.
- The formula for calculating the enrichment efficiency has been tested.
- Features that were not available in the test sample were analyzed.
- The change in the concentration of elements at each stage was studied.
- The distributions of granule sizes on the training and test samples and the total concentrations were studied.
- Found the share of gold in concentrates and tailings.
- Several forecasting models were built, trained and analyzed.
- A function has been written to calculate the final custom *sMAPE*.
- The best model was selected, its quality was checked on a test sample.
- Predicted the efficiency of rough concentrate enrichment and the efficiency of enrichment of the final concentrate. 
  

**Result:**
- A model was built to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore.
