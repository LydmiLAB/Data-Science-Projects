**Description:**  

- For an online store that sells computer games around the world, the parameters that determine the success of a game in different regions of the world have been identified. Portraits of game users have been compiled for each region. Conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
The period for analysis was analyzed and determined taking into account the specifics of the industry.
The hypotheses were tested using Student's t-test for independent samples: 
    - Average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
    - The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
 
**Result:**
- A potentially profitable product for planning advertising campaigns has been identified.
