**Description:**  

- The online store is launching a new service for users to edit and supplement product descriptions by suggesting edits and comments on changes to others. It is necessary to train a model to search for toxic comments with a customer-specified accuracy of 0.75 f1-measures.
- Data has been preprocessed, tokenized and vectorized. 2 models were trained with different sets of hyperparameters and the best one was selected from the training set.
- The best model was tested, the quality exceeded the threshold value of the customerâ€™s metric.
 
**Result:**
- A comment classification model has been developed to determine their toxicity.
