# Predicting Profitable Oil Regions

| Data            |  Task                | Libraries and tools | 
| :--------------: | :---------------------------: |:----------------------:|
|  Oil samples in three regions and characteristics for each well: oil quality and volume of its reserves.| Create a model to determine a profitable oil production region, analyze possible profits and risks.| Python, sklearn, Pandas, numpy, seaborn, Matplotlib, datetime, tqdm, bootstrap / histogram, barplot, class imbalance|


**Description:**  

- -- The average stock of predicted raw materials and the size of the error for each region were calculated. 
 -- A sufficient volume of raw materials has been calculated for the break-even development of a new well. 
  -- Profit in each region is calculated.
  -- A model was built to predict the volume of reserves of new wells. 
  -- Potential risks, profits and confidence intervals for each region and
analyzed using Bootstrap method.
 
**Result:**
- A model was built to determine the region where oil production will bring the greatest profit.
