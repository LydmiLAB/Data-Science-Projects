**Description:**  

- The operator needs to find users in advance, who plans to refuse services connections, they will offer promotional codes and special conditions.
The threshold value of the customer metric is more than 0.85 AUC-ROC.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, selection of hyperparameters using different optimizers, training several classification models on a training set, analysis of model training results, selection of the best model.
- Testing the best model on a test sample and its analysis: checking for passing the customer’s metric threshold and for adequacy, studying the importance of features (feature selection), error matrix.
 
**Result:**
- A model has been developed to predict customer churn in order to reduce it and plan an advertising campaign. The model passed the threshold value of the customer's metric and the adequacy test.
