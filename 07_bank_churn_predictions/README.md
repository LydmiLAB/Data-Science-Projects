|  Historical data on customer behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.| To predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not.| Python, sklearn, Pandas, numpy, seaborn, Matplotlib, datetime, tqdm / histogram, barplot, class imbalance|


**Description:**  

- Every month clients began to leave the bank. Customers began to leave the bank every month. A model was built to predict the likelihood of a client leaving the bank in the near future.
The data has been processed and the class imbalance has been worked out. Several models were trained with GridSearchCV hyperparameter optimizers. The best model was selected and tested, showing quality F1 0.61, and passed the adequacy test. An additional quality assessment was carried out - the AUC-ROC plot.
 
**Result:**
- A classification model has been built that predicts whether a bank client will leave. The quality of the model exceeds the customer's threshold.
