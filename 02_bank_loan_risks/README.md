|  Statistics of the client’s solvency. |Investigate whether the marital status and number of children the client has affects the timely repayment of loans, based on given data.| Python, Pandas, numpy, Sklearn, SciPy, Matplotlib|


**Description:**  

- Client data was loaded and preprocessed: omissions were processed, data types were replaced with the necessary ones, duplicates were removed, lemmas were defined and categories of features were classified.
 
**Result:**
- A credit scoring model has been constructed as a system of methods for assessing the borrower’s ability to repay the loan to the bank on time. A portrait of a reliable borrower has been drawn up.
