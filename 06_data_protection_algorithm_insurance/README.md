**Description:**  
- It is necessary to protect the data of the insurance company's clients using a data transformation method so that it is difficult to recover personal information from it. And also so that the quality of machine learning models does not deteriorate during conversion. 
- We described and implemented the data transformation algorithm: generating an invertible matrix, checking its invertibility and correct encryption of features, constructing linear regression and comparing the R2 metric before and after transforming the feature matrix.
- We checked that the original signs are encrypted - the original data is not visible and cannot be obtained without the encryption key.
  

**Result:**
- A correct data encryption algorithm has been developed.
