| User behavior data |To explore the data and compare the behavior and preferences of Yandex Music users in two cities by testing hypotheses| Python, Pandas|


**Description:**  

- The analysis focuses on the difference in music listening behavior on the Yandex.Music service between clients in Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is crucial for the business to validate three hypotheses:

    - User activity depends on the day of the week, and this pattern varies between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
    - Different music genres predominate on Monday mornings and Friday evenings in Moscow compared to St. Petersburg.
    - Moscow and St. Petersburg exhibit preferences for different music genres, with Moscow leaning towards pop music and St. Petersburg favoring Russian rap.
 

**Result:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted, and three hypotheses were tested. Data were examined for errors, and their impact on the study was assessed. During the preprocessing stage, efforts were made to address and rectify the most critical errors in the data.
