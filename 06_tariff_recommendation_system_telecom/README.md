# Classification model for tariff recommendation system

| Data            |  Task                | Libraries and tools | 
| :--------------: | :---------------------------: |:----------------------:|
|  Data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to the tariffs under study| build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate tariff| Python, sklearn, Pandas, numpy, seaborn, Matplotlib, datetime / histogram, barplot|


**Description:**  

- In the cellular operator, many customers use archived tariffs. Customer behavior analyzed. Several classification models are built and analyzed to help recommend optimal sets of services for users. The best model on the training dataset was selected. It was tested on a test dataset.
 
**Result:**
- A classification model has been built that will allow you to select an appropriate tariff with an accuracy on a test sample of more than 0.75 accuracy, exceeding the customerâ€™s threshold.
