**Description:**  
- To attract more drivers during peak periods, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model for such a prediction is being built. The RMSE metric value on the test sample should be no more than 48.
- The time series is analyzed, preprocessed, resampled,
components are highlighted. Feature engineering carried out.
- 4 models were trained with hyperparameter optimization, the best model was selected. It was tested on a test sample. The model passed the quality threshold specified by the customer and the adequacy test.

**Result:**
- A predicting the volume of taxi orders model was built to attract more drivers during peak periods.
