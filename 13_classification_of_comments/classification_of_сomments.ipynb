       " '\"\\n\\nIs it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don\\'t answer the questions beyond that\\nWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \\n\\nFirst, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \\n\\nSecond, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it\\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \\n\\nFinally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\\'s what killed him. You don\\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\\'ve never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\\'t science.  \"',\n",

       " 'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.\\n\\nThe major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.',\n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.\\n\\nThe Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           History\\nThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       Proper History\\nAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\",\n",

LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) \\nBy the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15\",\n",

       " '\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == \\nInvitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \\nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \\n\\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \\nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \\nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

Thank you. \\n\\n Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 \\n\\n  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false \"\"suicidal\"\" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. \\n\\nCome oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. \\n\\nBut remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing \"\"El País\"\" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  \\n\\n \\n\\nIndeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the \"\"moral certitudes\"\" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.\\n\\n  I agree with you 100%, Larean.\\n\\n  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. \\n\\n  You are right, Southofwatford, in your \"\"Randroide omits...\"\" section.\\n\\nIf you have not subscription to \"\"El País\"\", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My \"\"institutional\"\" access also has some advantages, like paid access to \"\"El País\"\" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of \"\"filtered\"\" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.\\n\\nDo you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.\\n\\nBTW, if you write under a \"\"Randroide answers\"\" section you are:\\nInvading \"\"my\"\" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.\\nRisking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE \"\"Randroide answers\"\" sections.\\n\\nIf you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not \"\"mine\"\".\\n\\n  I\\'ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it\\'s very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAll sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article\\n\\nVery funny, Southofwatford. \\n\\nI am going to follow this joke of yours.\\n\\nPlease propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.\\nDelete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.\\nDelete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.\\n\\nIt´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.\\n\\nUser:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it\\'s simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.\\n\\n 08:3',\n",

That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

       " '\"\\n\\n66.185.85.80\\'s rant\\n\\nPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as \"\"primitive\"\" and \"\"rural\"\" (even \"\"fashist\"\") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, \"\"performed\"\" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.\\n \\nAnother \"\"apostle\"\" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as \"\"gusle players\"\". \\n\\nSome even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović\\'s book \"\"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje\"\", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. \\n \\nNot far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić\\'s work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  \\n\\nIn addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn\\'t play gusle (it\\'s    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. \\n\\nOlinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. \\n\\nThe Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  \"\"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West\"\" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)\\n\\nThis admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)\\n\\nNow, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. \\n\\nHaving this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock \\'n\\' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre',\n",

And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin\\'s strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party\\'s subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.  \"',\n",

However, administrators are generally only able to block users if they have received a recent final warning (one that mentions that the user may be blocked) and they have recently vandalized after that warning was given.  The reported user has not yet been blocked because it appears this has not occurred yet. If this user continues to vandalize even after their final warning, please report them to the AIV noticeboard again. Thank you!  (talk) \"',\n",

       " 'In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.',\n",

Apart from there being facts/proof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river ( including geological facts as to why it dried up) The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus, ( refuting point 3 of the passage quoted above ) and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of it's own. And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system, none of them are of the scale of Harrapa / Mohenjodaro, leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one.

       " '\":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.\\n\\n Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. \\n\\n To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn\\'t have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. \\n\\n Saying that DLA has \"\" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ...\"\" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like \"\"in major financial centres\"\" or \"\"in major commercial centres\"\" or \"\"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres\"\" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.\\n\\n I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  \\n\\n\"',\n",

He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn\\'t even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN\\'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I\\'ll tell you why: the user wasn\\'t engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I\\'d guess it\\'s some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don\\'t really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn\\'t directly related to content and improving articles.

I don\\'t have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don\\'t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn\\'t me here, it\\'s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don\\'t recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn\\'t quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it\\'s having a very chilling effect across wikipedia.

The following has been removed from the article.\\n\\n\"\"Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. \"\"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,\"\" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. \"\"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.\"\"Henry Adams, \"\"The Session,\"\" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  \"\"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,\"\" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.\\n\\n\"\"Boutwell\\'s financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.\"\"Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.\\'\\'\"\"\\n\\n\"',\n",

       " '\"\\n\\n Question on Possible Citation \\n\\nI\\'m sorry if I missed your question - I don\\'t pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven\\'t yet worked in \"\"no original research\"\".) WP:NOR says that we mustn\\'t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don\\'t arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. \\n\\nGetting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I\\'m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. \\n\\nOverall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects \"\"warts and all\"\" we shouldn\\'t enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - \\n\\n\"\"but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources.\"\" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn\\'t clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don\\'t see how that can be objective. \\n\\n Bauer \\nI\\'m sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I\\'ve been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn\\'t seem like a lynch mob. Y\\'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I\\'m glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don\\'t mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   \\n I would say Karen saying I\\'ve called her names is an out and out fabrication. I\\'ve never done any such thing. \\n\\n\"\"or whether it\\'s because he\\'s been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences\"\"\\n\\nI\\'ve accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn\\'t namecalling by a long stretch. I\\'m really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she\\'s hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won\\'t make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It\\'s the Internet equivalent of stoning. \\n\\nThis is not a fabrication. I get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or \"\"group troll,\"\" or a \"\"self-interested partisan,\"\" or a \"\"blog comment commando,\"\" or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself. You also made a \"\"theoretical\"\" comment about me being \"\"nosy, fat and ugly.\"\" Putting the word \"\"if\"\" in front of it doesn\\'t make it any less of an insult.

And, please notice, like abi (Avi is Avraham the admin, abi the ML commenter who believes in kindness) I counseled against piling on.  | Talk | contribs \\n\\nThose are not ad hominem names Karen.

       " '\"\\n\\n stradbroke galleon / portuguese \\n\\nhallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by \"\"mainstream\"\" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the \"\"mainstream\"\" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian\\'s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian\\'s antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    \"',\n",

Where many Wikipedia editors \"\"get it wrong\"\" is that they believe Wikipedia\\'s job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia\\'s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.

If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents \"\"THE TRUTH\"\" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.\\n\\nI have been trying to hit this NPOV \"\"sweet spot\"\" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.\\n\\n \\nObviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don\\'t want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that\\'s not discussion about the NPOV edits.

This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: \"\"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who \"\"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth\"\" but this was dismissed as \"\"speculative opinion\"\" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  \"',\n",

That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.\\n\\nAll of my references are verifiable.There\\'s nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn\\'t put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.\\n\\nI went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can\\'t remember who and don\\'t know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn\\'t know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.\\n\\nI did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan\\'t really hide that.   I didn\\'t add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words \"\"pro se\"\" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.\\n\\nI believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is \"\"soap boxing\"\". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I\\'ve been an entrepreneur. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.\\n\\nArguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven\\'t got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen\\'s comp, which is of course related to unions.  \"',\n",

I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.\\n\\nI am expecting that this user \"\"Laveol\"\" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.\\nOurs is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.\\n\\nDamemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    \\n\\nSome insight into my user name Ejanev\\nThe only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is \"\"Ejanev\"\".

You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.\\n\\nThis entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you\\'d think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation\\n\\n\"\"According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa\\'d ibn Mua\\'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: \"\"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.\"\" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba\\'s gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.\"\"\\n\\nThis author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it\\'s a fact?\\n\\nThere are articles for \"\"Criticisms of Islam\"\" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate \"\"criticisms of Islam\"\" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.\\n\\nGood day.\\n\\n  \\n\\nPlease read this talk page, specifically all of the places where \"\"treason\"\" or \"\"traitor\"\" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   \\n\\nChanges by Devotus and issues with them\\n\\nDear Devotus, \\nI have still issues with your changes:\\nBat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don\\'t try you shift the balance - removing a book from \"\"each side\"\" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn\\'t serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.\\nWhile your first version was needlessly verbose (\"\"it is to be noted that\"\"), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.\\nAlso we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the \"\"siege and demise\"\", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.\\nAlso, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like \"\"massacre\"\" and \"\"execution\"\" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.\\nThe common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s',\n",

       " \"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.\\n\\nYou have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.\\n\\nWe want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.\\n\\nTo extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).\\n\\nAnd we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)\\n\\nNext, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! \\n\\nNot too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).\\n\\nThus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.\",\n",

       " '\"{{Unblock|I\\'ll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:\\n\\n1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you \"\"admins\"\" tend to lean towards the side of someone who\\'s editing with an account over someone who\\'s editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as \"\"personal attacks\"\" or \"\"harassment\"\" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?\\n\\n2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I\\'m just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of \"\"ebaY\"\" logo to go next to the current one, \"\"ebay,\"\" in the lead, is \"\"because I wanted it in there,\"\" even though that is a total lie; but it\\'s supposedly \"\"not okay\"\" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?\\n\\n3. Here\\'s another one: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him and \"\"smiley girl\"\" there to falsely accuse my edits of being \"\"vandalism\"\" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a \"\"personal attack\"\" just because I\\'m an IP-only editor?\\n\\n4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with \"\"Oh, you can\\'t do that \\'cause that\\'s a \\'personal attack\\',\"\" or \"\"Oh, that\\'s bad because that\\'s \\'harassment\\' \"\"?\\n\\n5. Oh yeah, here\\'s one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn\\'t even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that \"\" \\'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring\\' is no defense\"\"? Well then doesn\\'t that apply to meeting some so-called \"\"consensus\"\" too (since some things aren\\'t cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called \"\"consensus\"\" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) \"\"consensus\"\" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who\\'s against your exclusive \"\"consensus,\"\" do the same thing, it\\'s \"\"edit-warring\"\" even though it was the same thing as what smiley\\'s doing (remember the \"\"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense\"\" rule)?\\n\\n75.162.211.81  \\n\\n\"',\n",

    "Сравнили результаты обучения: модель BertForSequenceClassification показала более высокую F1 метрику, чем модель LogisticRegression, однако скорость обучения модели BertForSequenceClassification при этом в несколько раз вые, чем у модели LogisticRegression\n",

    "Можно сделать вывод, что модель BertForSequenceClassification лучше справляется с задачей классификации тональности твитов, чем модель LogisticRegression. BertForSequenceClassification обучается на больших объемах текстовых данных, что позволяет ей выучивать более сложные зависимости между словами и контекстом в тексте, что полезно для анализа тональности, так как многие слова и выражения могут иметь неочевидную тональность, которую модель должна учитывать. \n",

    "\n",
    "Можно сделать вывод, что модель BertForSequenceClassification лучше справляется с задачей классификации тональности твитов, чем модель LogisticRegression. BertForSequenceClassification обучается на больших объемах текстовых данных, что позволяет ей выучивать более сложные зависимости между словами и контекстом в тексте, что полезно для анализа тональности, так как многие слова и выражения могут иметь неочевидную тональность, которую модель должна учитывать. \n",
    "\n",
    "Поэтому для тестирования была выбрана BertForSequenceClassification.\n",
    " \n",
    " **В результате тестирования модель показала значение качества f1 0.82, которое удовлетворяет критерию заказчика f1 более 0.75.**  \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Следовательно, **заказчику рекомендуем использовать модель BertForSequenceClassification**, которая является более предпочтительным выбором для анализа тональности твитов, так как она может достичь более высокой меры качества f1 при классификации. При этом стоит отметить, что модель BertForSequenceClassification требует значительных вычислительных ресурсов и времени для обучения."
